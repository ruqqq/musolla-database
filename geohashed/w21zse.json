On Sunday mornings, hundreds of children dressed in their Muslim attire complete with headgear stroll into the mosque compounds to be part of the various religious classes. The masjid, which is located in the East, can fill up to 3,000 worshippers.Â  Built under the Mosque Building Fund in November 1994, it replaced the older generation mosque of the same name.",
