    "remarks": "The brick-clad wall panels which blend with the nearby sports facilities have given way to a bluish tile after an extensive and major repair work was carried out in 1999. Built under the Mosque Building Fund in 1991, the masjid sited next to busy Tampines Central in the East can accommodate up to 4,500 people. It has daily kindergarten and madrasah classes. In the evening, the masjid is a bustle of activities as men and women attend the various religious classes offered",
