    "remarks": "At one glance, it looked like any other kampung house which is slowly becoming a rare sight in a city of concrete jungle. This old generation masjid built in 1973 can accommodate up to 300 worshippers. The rather isolated masjid in the Central zone and presently caters to Television Corporation of Singapore staff nearby. Its activities include korban, Eid and Friday prayers.",

Today, the one-storey masjid, which is located in the Central, can accommodate up to 400 worshippers for daily and Friday prayers. It is also crowded during Hari Raya prayers. On Thursday evenings, many Muslims gather for recitation of praises to Allah.",
