    "remarks": "A squarish minaret in this Mosque Building Fund masjid combines Malay architecture and Islamic art. Nominated for the prestigious Aga Khan Award in 1989 as an excellent example of tropical architecture, the masjid features the early pitched-roof structure commonly found in the Malay archipelago. Built in 1986, the masjid located in the East can accommodate up to 3,500 people. Besides madrasah classes, it is also popular venue for haj courses organized by travel agents. The masjid has since undergone a major addition and alteration project which was completed in 2005.",
