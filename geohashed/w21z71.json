    "remarks": "The masjid was a contribution by the Chulian community. Built in 1826, it has gone through several places of renovation and expansion. The building bears the imprint of South Indian architecture in its narrow frontages, which are defined by minaret-style towers. Located in the Central part of the island, it serves office workers and has a capacity of 1500 people. It is one of the few masjids in Singapore, which organizes religious classes in Tamil.",

    "remarks": "The masjid, which bears the imprint of South Indian architecture in its narrow frontages, which are defined by two minaret-style towers, was founded in 1827. But it was only in 1855, that a formal building was set up. In 1974, the old generation masjid located in Central Singapore was gazetted as one of the national monuments. With a capacity of 500, it serves the needs of office workers in the Shenton Road area. Unlike neighbourhood masjids, which spring to life in the evening, this masjid is relatively quiet except for its occasional Tafsir Al-Quran (Al-Quran interpretation) courses.",
