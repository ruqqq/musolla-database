    "remarks": "Nested amidst the private house of the well-to-do Malays in the East, this old generation masjid was built in 1965. The masjid with a capacity of 300, underwent minor renovations in 1997 to include additional facilities. It has a full-time imam (religious teacher) and noja (masjid helper). Religious classes are held on an ad-hoc basis. There are religious classes for the ladies every Thursday evening. Classes for the men are held every Friday evening.Â  Currently, major upgrading works are currently being done on the mosque.",
