    "remarks": "Tucked away among Housing Board skyscraper flats, this redeveloped masjid was built on the old site of surau Delta which was first built in 1960. The new two-storey building was completed in 1995 increasing its capacity to 500 people. Its main activities are confined to daily and Friday prayers as well as celebrations of Maulid and other religious occasions.",
