    "remarks": "In sharp contrast to a Saracenic style masjid or avant-garde looking religious structures, this old generation masjid is simple yet functional. Located at the junction of Bristol Road and Carlisle Road, this one-storey masjid can accommodate up to 120 people. Built in 1907 its main activities include daily and Friday prayers as well as occasional religious lectures.",
