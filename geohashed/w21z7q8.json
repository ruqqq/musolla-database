    "remarks": "If there is one masjid, which attracts a wide range of nationalities, it must be the Masjid Angullia. Located along one of Singaporeâ€™s busiest main roads in the Central district, the mosque is a place for devotion of shoppers across the road at Serangoon Plaza as well as shopkeepers and office workers nearby. It can accommodate 400 Muslims any one time. Built with funds from a wealthy Angullia family in 1970, it has an Indian-like minaret. Today, it is famous as a center of tabligh (activities to promote Islam).",
