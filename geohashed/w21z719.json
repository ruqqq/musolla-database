    "remarks": "The masjid was a contribution by the Chulian community. Built in 1826, it has gone through several places of renovation and expansion. The building bears the imprint of South Indian architecture in its narrow frontages, which are defined by minaret-style towers. Located in the Central part of the island, it serves office workers and has a capacity of 1500 people. It is one of the few masjids in Singapore, which organizes religious classes in Tamil.",
