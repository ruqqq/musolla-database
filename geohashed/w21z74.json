    "remarks": "The oldest masjid in Singapore, it has humble beginnings as a wooden surau way back in 1820. Monetary contributions from wealthy merchant Syed Abdullah bin Omar Aljunied made possible its rebuilding in 1855. The old generation masjid located in the Central, underwent yet another major rebuilding project several years ago in which a tall minaret with a small roof dome is added at the entrance of the mosque. With a capacity of 500 people, it is the focal point for office workers during daily and Friday prayers",
