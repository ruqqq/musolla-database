    "remarks": "Located in the North part of the island, An-Nur is more than just a landmark in Woodlands. The masjid has created a name for its outreach programme and grassroots activities through its Qaryah (outreach) initiatives. It is also one of the masjids, which provide strong support for the kidney donation campaign. Built in 1980 under the Mosque Building fund, An-Nur can accommodate up to 2800 worshippers. There are madrasah and kindergarten classes offered at the masjid to children of the neighbouring estate",
