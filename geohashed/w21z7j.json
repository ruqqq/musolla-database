    "remarks": "Originally built in 1859, this masjid with its unique architecture has earned the distinction as  one of Singapore's national monuments. It has an unabashed mélange of styles – a mix of Southern Indian, Moghul and Europeans influences.  Located in the Central part of Singapore, it has since been redeveloped (re-opened in 1998) with a capacity of 3000 and offers madrasah classes in Tamil besides its usual religious classes.",
