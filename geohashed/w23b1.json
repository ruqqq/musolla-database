It is Singapore’s 26th mosque to be funded by the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund (MBMF). Masjid Yusof Ishak is designed with a unique architecture blending traditional mosque characteristics with Nusantara heritage and elements, while also addressing functional requirements. Distinctive features of a tropical Nusantara house, such as eaves/overhangs, verandah, decorative fixed ventilation panels and beautifully crafted balustrades, are reinterpreted and expressed in a modern way befitting this new generation mosque.",
