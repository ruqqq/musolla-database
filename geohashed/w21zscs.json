    "remarks": "Al-Ansar with its prominent tower minaret is among the first few masjids built under the Phase One of the Mosque Building Fund. Completed in 1981, the masjid located in the East can fill up to 3000 people at any one time. Located in the heart of the densely populated Bedok housing estate, the masjid offers madrasah classes. It is also one of the few masjids, which organizes religious classes in Tamil and one of the only two masjids with a full-time welfare officer.",
