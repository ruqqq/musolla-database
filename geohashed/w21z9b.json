With resettlement, the masjid located in the Central area now serves the workers in Bukit Timah area and some residents nearby. Built in 1966, the masjid, which can accommodate up to 400 people, has undergone several renovations. Its activities are confined to daily and Friday prayers as well as celebrations of Islamic festivities.",
